          SKY BOOKS is a fast growing, research-driven company, with a view to
          revolutionise learning systems. We publish high quality educational
          material and provide support services to both, the learner and the
          educator. Our Authors, Editors and Educational Consultants have a
          collective experience of more than twenty years in Teaching,
          Publishing and Designing Curriculum. At SKY BOOKS, we are conscious of
          the increasingly dynamic learning environment of today and the
          challenges it brings with it. The books we publish go beyond merely
          providing the 3Rs. They not only make learning and teaching purposeful
          but also provide the right foundation to develop the twenty-first
          century skills that children need to succeed. The books are learner
          centric and make the teaching process effective and meaningful for the
          facilitators and educators. While adhering to the syllabus and
          pedagogy of the subject, our books incorporate age-appropriate and
          authentic references, avoid stereotypes and inculcate relevant and
          useful life skills and values. The books guide the children towards
          self-learning, completely doing away with rote learning. To facilitate
          today’s educators to utilize their time optimally, we provide support
          in a variety of formats such as print, digital and interactive
          learning resources. Today, we have several satisfied users and this
          list is growing. The simple, comprehensible yet compelling content
          that is visually appealing will help learners with diverse learning
          styles, ability levels and skills.
